## Completed Requirements

- I have completed ALL the given requirements.
- I have executed Responsive design effectively.
- And I have also implemented smooth animation effects.
- Regarding the requirement to deploy the application to Heroku, due to Heroku no longer offering free hosting, I have deployed it to [Vercel](https://goldensneaker.vercel.app) instead, with the following URL: 
```bash
https://goldensneaker.vercel.app
```
- For the Products data, since Heroku no longer provides free usage, I have deployed it to [render.com](https://golden-sneaker-apis.onrender.com/shoes), with the following URL:
```bash
https://golden-sneaker-apis.onrender.com/shoes
```
- And here is the source code of my Products data APIs written in [Node.js](https://github.com/nguyenletrongnhanofficial/golden_sneaker_apis):
```bash
https://github.com/nguyenletrongnhanofficial/golden_sneaker_apis
```
- Hmm... with render.com, if it's not used for a while, it will temporarily go offline until it's used again. So, I coded it in a way that if the program doesn't receive product data within 50 microseconds, it will retrieve the data I have stored within the program. I hope you will like my solutionüòá.
